# VispH

VispH is a video analysis tool that allows you to analyze videos of solutions with pH indicators as
they change over time, plotting the change in hue over time.

The conversion from hue to pH was determined empirically by regressing experimental data with Desmos:

Solving for pH:
pH = ln(((5/hue)-0.100867)/0.00000572328)/1.32139
